LICENSE NOTICE

- We wanted to take a moment to remind you of Metronic's license terms to ensure continued compliance and support for your projects. 
Each Metronic license is intended for a single use, meaning each deployment or project requires a separate license. 
If you're using Metronic for a SaaS service where end users are charged, an extended license is required. 
For full details on our license terms, please visit: https://keenthemes.com/metronic/tailwind/docs/getting-started/license

- As the largest template kit on the market, maintaining and expanding Metronic requires significant resources. 
Your contribution helps us deliver on our promise of innovation, with exciting new features on the way 
for the latest Metronic Tailwind, React, Next.js, and MUI versions, including Calendar, Datepicker, 
Daterangepicker, Advanced Select, Autocomplete for JavsScript version, and more. 

- We understand that some buyers might be unaware of these terms and may use a single license for multiple projects 
or a regular license for SaaS projects. However, after our friendly reminders, most users are quick to correct these 
issues once they’re made aware. If you fully comply with the license terms, please feel free to ignore this email.

- To purchase a new license, simply follow https://1.envato.market/Vm7VRE to but a regular license and 
https://1.envato.market/daX0Ej to buy an extended license. Your continued support through proper licensing is crucial for Metronic’s growth. 

Thank you for your understanding and for being part of the Metronic community. 
We look forward to supporting your development needs in the future.
